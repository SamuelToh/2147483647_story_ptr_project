Technologies I explored:
NPM - a package manager for javascript and used by node - default<p>
express-generator package - a scaffolding application that uses the nodejs framework to create a number of  directories similar to Rails framework to provide a headstart for building web application.<br>
                            How is it similar to rails? I think it is similar because I am seeing familiar directories like Asset Routes etc etc. *I'm not sure whether is it a fair comment to say 
                            it is similar to Rails or not thou:(
